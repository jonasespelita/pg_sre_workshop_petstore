## Incident Management

### Common Issues

1. **Service Unavailable**: Check Cloud Run service status and logs.
2. **Database Connectivity**: Verify database connection settings and network configurations.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Identify the Issue**: Use Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging to identify the root cause.
2. **Check Service Health**: Verify the health of the Cloud Run service and dependent services.
3. **Review Logs**: Analyze logs in Google Cloud Logging for errors and warnings.
4. **Restart Service**: If necessary, escalate to admin for restarting the Cloud Run service from the GCP Console.

### Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to
infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems. SREs
are responsible for the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency
response, and capacity planning of their services.

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput,
frequency, response time, or quality. SLOs are used to define the target level of reliability for a service. They are
critical for maintaining a balance between releasing new features and ensuring the reliability of the service.
